# Nuxt 3 + Tailwind CSS Starter Template

A modern, opinionated starter template for Nuxt 3 projects with Tailwind CSS, optimized for productive development with GitHub Copilot.

## 🚀 The Vibe

This template is designed for **flow state coding** - where you and GitHub Copilot work together seamlessly. We've pre-configured everything to help you focus on building, not configuring.

### 🤖 GitHub Copilot Integration

- **📋 Check [`TASKLIST.md`](./TASKLIST.md)** before starting work - it tracks priorities and context
- **📖 Read [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md)** for tech stack guidance
- **✅ Update tasks** as you work - keep the flow going for future sessions

### 🛠 Tech Stack
